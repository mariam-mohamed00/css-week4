                <p class="text">" Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step bt step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were every hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "</p>
